Representation of software streamlines is a very powerful way to visualize software history. It is possible to incorporate up to 14 different properties, metrics or relationships into software streamline representation, such as time, version numbers, version patterns, Version Control System artifacts, streamline types and many others. } % end of abstract

Primary target audience of software streamlines visualization is release engineers. Release engineers will find beneficial to use visualization of software streamlines to: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Track history of software applications
\item Analyze and control complexity of software projects
\item Allocate resources for support of existing and future version of software applications
\item Manage infrastructure and deployments of software versions to target environments
\end{itemize}
We expect that software streamlines visualization will also be useful for software engineers, software testing engineers, quality assurance/process engineers, support engineers, project managers and researchers.

\section{Questions from users}
There are several categories of streamline visualization users that might ask different kind of questions about data:

\paragraph{Release engineers}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Frequency.} How often does software development team produce new version of software application? 
		\item \textbf{Team.} How many developers work on different parts/branches/streamlines of software application? Correlates with previous question and helps to predict how often new version of software application is getting released from different branches/streamlines.
		\item \textbf{Source code.} How much source code (LOC, size of diffs between versions) does software application contain? Answer to this question might help to predict how long it usually takes to build/rebuild application from scratch and deploy it to the target platform. Which, in turn, helps with calculation of ETA for releases and deployments of software applications.
		\item \textbf{Deployments.} What are the most recently released/deployed versions of software application? What are the platforms where application is deployed? What are the recent/upcoming versions of software applications that require deployment? 
	\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Software engineers}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Context.} What am I currently working on? I want to see the version of software application I am currently working on and how it is related to other (past, future, similar) versions of the same application.
	\item \textbf{Bugfixes.} I want to fix bug in version a.b.c. What is the branch/streamline I should work on to get rid of the bug in the majority of other versions of the same software application? I fixed bug in version a.b.c. Where else should I fix it? 
	\item \textbf{Source code changes.} What kinds of changes am I allowed to perform in certain branches? What is the most appropriate place (branch/streamline) for my change?
	\item \textbf{Compatibility.} Where do I need to reimplement existing feature from scratch due to restrictions of versions compatibility?
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Software testing engineers}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Bugs.} I found bug x in version a.b.c. What other versions should I test in order to find the same bug or similar bugs? What is the version of software application where bug x appeared first? When I report bug, what versions should I mention? 
		\item \textbf{Features.} I donâ€™t want to spend unnecessary effort testing feature x and creating erroneous bug-reports related to this feature. I want to know when and where (version) did feature x appear first time?
	\end{enumerate}
	
\paragraph{Project managers, quality assurance and process engineers}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Quality.} How many bugs do different versions of software application usually have? What is the threshold of allowed number of bugs for different versions? Do number of bugs and their severity depend on type and maturity level of artifact where they were found?
		\item \textbf{Process.} What are the bottlenecks in the process? When does it take more time to release next version of software application?  When is it appropriate to introduce specific practice to improve software development process (for example, will practice of static analysis be more effective for development streamlines or release streamlines based on frequency of software builds/releases?)
	\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Researchers}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Statistics.} How do such metrics as number of developers, lines of source code and methodologies affect speed, quality and cost of development? 
		\item \textbf{Prediction.} Estimate probability of certain events (problems with compatibility, spending more time for software delivery than initially estimated) happening based on historical data. 
		\item \textbf{Theories.} Investigating correlation between different metrics to come up with new hypotheses about software evolution. Investigating how conclusions generalize for different cases by comparing visualizations for different versions of software.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Abstract operations}
We use \textit{filtering} as the main abstract operation for streamline visualizations. By default, only one variable is available for display to abstract away unnecessary information. User is able to select additional data to extend default visualization representation by selecting other options in filtering form. You can see example of form used for filtering on \ref{abstract_operations}:
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{abstract_operations}
\caption{Abstract operations, variables and their encodings}
\label{abstract_operations}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data type abstractions}

We use following data type abstractions for our variables (see \ref{data_variables}):
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
\item \textit{Numeric} for version numbers, timestamps, lines of source code, size of development team, number of deployed applications.
\item \textit{Ordinal} for version numbers and maturity levels
\item Nominal for version control system artifacts (branch names) and deployment platforms
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Encodings}
We use following encodings for our visual representation:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
\item Text
\item Horizontal arrow
\item Color (gradations of brown, gradations of green)
\item Shapes (rectangles and circles)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Justification for chosen encodings}

We use \textit{text} to display versions and branch names.

In order to represent time, we use \textit{horizontal arrow} pointing from left to right. Left-to-right arrow is one the most common representations for timelines. It is widely used as mathematical notation to represent time. Also left-to-right is considered to be default direction of ordering in Western culture.

We chose \textit{color} to encode two variables: 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
\item {\color{Green}Green} for maturity levels. We chose green to represent maturity because it can be naturally associated with maturity in nature where light green usually represents less mature state and dark green represents more mature state of fruits, leaves and vegetation.
\item {\color{Brown}Brown} for density of commits. We chose brown color because it is typical color for a branch and such metric as density of commits is applicable only to branches. Gradations of brown represent variation of density (light brown - for low density, dark brown - for high density of commits). 
\end{enumerate}

\textit{Circles and rectangles} represent mutability/immutability of visualized artifacts. While we consider branches to be mutable artifacts, snapshots are immutable. We use \textit{rectangles} to encode immutability because rectangular form reminds of a box, package or container - entities that might serve as a representation for concept of immutability. We use \textit{circles} to encode immutability because circular shape reminds of spinning, motion and, therefore, can be used to encode concept of change. While circle alone represents potential change, \textit{circle combined with an curved arrow inside the circle} can be used to represent actual ongoing change. We use this encoding to represent ongoing process of building software (continuous integration activity).

We use \textit{arrows} to represent from-to relationship between artifacts. Arrows is one of the most convenient ways to denote which entity of of two comes first and which one comes second. For example, arrows represent operation of copying branch content to create snapshot. In this case branch comes first and snapshot comes second.
